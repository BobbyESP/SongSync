### Building
To build this app, it is recommended to create a file called `local.properties` in the root directory of the project. This file should contain the following lines:
```properties
spotify_client_id=<your spotify client id>
spotify_client_secret=<your spotify client secret>
```
You can get these values by creating a new app on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
